    "text": "📖 Introduction\nIn Singapore, the residential property market is bifurcated into public and private sectors. The public housing sector serves households with a monthly income of up to S$14,000, aiming to offer affordable housing solutions to the broader community. In contrast, the private housing sector caters to households with incomes surpassing S$14,000.\nFor this analysis, we will leverage REALIS transaction data covering the period from 1st January 2023 to 31st March 2024. Our exploration will be conducted using ggplot2 and its associated extensions.\n\n\nSetting the Scene\nIn this scenario, we assume the role of a graphical editor for a media company. We have been tasked with creating data visualizations to illuminate the private residential market and its sub-markets in Singapore for the first quarter of 2024.\n\n\nData Preparation\nLoad R Packages\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, haven,\n               ggrepel, ggthemes,\n               ggridges, ggdist,\n               patchwork, scales,\n               viridis, cowplot, \n               dplyr, plotly,\n               tidyr, lubridate, \n               ggplot2, ggExtra)\n\nIdentify the missing values in the data set and removed any missing elements. ‘Type of Sale’ and ‘Property type’ has been converted to factor format. ‘Transacted Price ($)’ and ‘Area (SQFT)’ are converted to numeric data types. ‘Type of Sale’ has been group into three categories. ‘Sale Date’ has been converted to Date format.\nThe process had been repeated for all five data sets.\n\nImport Data SetsConverting DataConverting Dates\n\n\n\nds1 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ds1.csv\")\nds2 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ds2.csv\")\nds3 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ds3.csv\")\nds4 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ds4.csv\")\nds5 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/ds5.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nprepare_dataset &lt;- function(ds) {\n  colSums(is.na(ds))\n  ds &lt;- na.omit(ds)\n  \n  ds$`Type of Sale` &lt;- tolower(as.character(ds$`Type of Sale`))\n  ds$`Type of Sale` &lt;- ifelse(ds$`Type of Sale` %in% c(\"new sale\", \"resale\"), ds$`Type of Sale`, \"other\")\n  ds$`Type of Sale` &lt;- as.factor(ds$`Type of Sale`)\n  \n  ds$`Property Type` &lt;- as.factor(ds$`Property Type`)\n  \n  ds$`Transacted Price ($)` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\"[^0-9.]\", \"\", ds$`Transacted Price ($)`, perl = TRUE))\n  ds$`Area (SQFT)` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\"[^0-9.]\", \"\", ds$`Area (SQFT)`, perl = TRUE))\n  ds$`Unit Price ($ PSF)` &lt;- as.numeric(gsub(\"[^0-9.]\", \"\", ds$`Unit Price ($ PSF)`, perl = TRUE))\n  \n  return(ds)\n}\n\n# Apply the function to each dataset\nds1 &lt;- prepare_dataset(ds1)\nds2 &lt;- prepare_dataset(ds2)\nds3 &lt;- prepare_dataset(ds3)\nds4 &lt;- prepare_dataset(ds4)\nds5 &lt;- prepare_dataset(ds5)\n\n# Combine the datasets\ncombined_ds &lt;- rbind(ds1, ds2, ds3, ds4, ds5)\n\n\n\n\n# Convert Sale Date to Date format\nds1$`Sale Date` &lt;- dmy(ds1$`Sale Date`)\nds2$`Sale Date` &lt;- dmy(ds2$`Sale Date`)\nds3$`Sale Date` &lt;- dmy(ds3$`Sale Date`)\nds4$`Sale Date` &lt;- dmy(ds4$`Sale Date`)\nds5$`Sale Date` &lt;- dmy(ds5$`Sale Date`)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDA\nIn this section, we will visualize the relationships between Property Types vs. Planning Region and Sale trend from Jan 2023 - Mar 2024.\n\nTransactions by Regions and Property TypeTransactions by MonthPurchaser Address IndicatorSale Categories vs. Property Types\n\n\n\n\nClick to show code\n\n\ntransactions_heatmap &lt;- combined_ds %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Planning Region`, `Property Type`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Transactions = n()) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nheatmap1 &lt;- ggplot(transactions_heatmap, aes(x = `Planning Region`, y = `Property Type`, fill = Transactions)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Transactions by Region and Property Type\",\n       x = \"Region\",\n       y = \"Property Type\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to show code\n\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\n\n# Combine all datasets into one dataframe\ncombined_ds &lt;- bind_rows(ds1, ds2, ds3, ds4, ds5)\n\n# Pre-process the combined dataset\ncombined_ds$`Sale Date` &lt;- as.Date(combined_ds$`Sale Date`, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\ncombined_ds$Year &lt;- year(combined_ds$`Sale Date`)\ncombined_ds$Month &lt;- factor(format(combined_ds$`Sale Date`, \"%b\"), levels = month.abb)\ncombined_ds$`Number of Units` &lt;- as.numeric(combined_ds$`Number of Units`)\n\n# Summarize data to get total units sold by month and year\nmonthly_sales_combined &lt;- combined_ds %&gt;%\n  group_by(Year, Month) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Units_Sold = sum(`Number of Units`, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(Month = factor(Month, levels = month.abb)) #

Read more.\nCentral Region Apartments are the most sought after in the market according to the heatmap, followed by condominiums.\nIn the new sale market, apartments represent 61% of sales, while condominiums make up 24.5%. In contrast, the resale market sees condominiums accounting for 48% and apartments at 27.2%. Detached, semi-detached, and terrace houses are less prevalent in both markets. This is attributed to land scarcity and high construction costs imposed by the Singapore government. Furthermore, many property owners retain these types of properties due to their freehold tenure.\nIt’s notable that a significant majority of private property buyers (presumably those residing in these properties) live in private residences. Interestingly, executive condominiums have the highest proportion of purchasers with HDB addresses, accounting for 53.6%. This could be attributed to the attractive rental yields in Singapore. Consequently, more residents might be purchasing executive condominiums primarily as investment properties.\n\n\n\n\nEDA 2\nWe analyzed unit price ($PSF) across Singapore’s planning regions for 2023, using four quarterly charts to visualize regional price variations. The Central Region consistently showed the highest median PSF, indicating its premium status. In contrast, the North East and East Regions maintained stable PSF values, balancing affordability with location.\n\n\nClick to show code\n\n\nq4 &lt;- ggplot(ds2, aes(x = `Planning Region`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSF)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Price per Square Foot by Planning Region - Oct 23 - Dec 23\",\n       x = \"Planning Region\",\n       y = \"Unit Price ($ PSF)\") +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 6)) \n\n# Price per Square Foot by Planning Region in DS3\nq3 &lt;- ggplot(ds3, aes(x = `Planning Region`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSF)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Price per Square Foot by Planning Region - Jul 23 - Sep 23\",\n       x = \"Planning Region\",\n       y = \"Unit Price ($ PSF)\") +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 6)) \n\n# Price per Square Foot by Planning Region in DS4\nq2 &lt;- ggplot(ds4, aes(x = `Planning Region`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSF)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Price per Square Foot by Planning Region - Apr 23 - Jun 23\",\n       x = \"Planning Region\",\n       y = \"Unit Price ($ PSF)\") +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 6)) \n\n# Price per Square Foot by Planning Region in DS5\nq1 &lt;- ggplot(ds5, aes(x = `Planning Region`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSF)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Price per Square Foot by Planning Region - Jan 23 - Mar 23\",\n       x = \"Planning Region\",\n       y = \"Unit Price ($ PSF)\") +\n  theme(text = element_text(size = 6)) \n\n\n\ncombined_plot &lt;- wrap_plots(q1, q2, q3, q4)\ncombined_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick to show code\n\n\ncombined_ds &lt;- bind_rows(\n  ds1 %&gt;% mutate(Data_Source = \"data/ds1.csv\"),\n  ds2 %&gt;% mutate(Data_Source = \"data/ds2.csv\"),\n  ds3 %&gt;% mutate(Data_Source = \"data/ds3.csv\"),\n  ds4 %&gt;% mutate(Data_Source = \"data/ds4.csv\"),\n  ds5 %&gt;% mutate(Data_Source = \"data/ds5.csv\"),\n)\n\nsummary_stats &lt;- combined_ds %&gt;%\n  group_by(`Planning Region`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    median_PSF = median(`Unit Price ($ PSF)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n    lower_quartile = quantile(`Unit Price ($ PSF)`, 0.25, na.rm = TRUE),\n    upper_quartile = quantile(`Unit Price ($ PSF)`, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\np &lt;- ggplot(combined_ds, aes(x = `Planning Region`, y = `Unit Price ($ PSF)`)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(\n    fun = median,\n    geom = \"point\",\n    shape = 23,\n    size = 3,\n    color = \"blue\",\n    position = position_dodge(width = 0.75)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Price per Square Foot by Planning Region - 2023 Q1-Q4\",\n    x = \"Planning Region\",\n    y = \"Unit Price ($ PSF)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\np_plotly &lt;- ggplotly(p, tooltip = c(\"Planning Region\", \"y\", \"Data_Source\", \"median_PSF\", \"lower_quartile\", \"upper_quartile\"))\n\np_plotly &lt;- plotly::ggplotly(p, tooltip = c(\"Planning Region\", \"y\", \"Data_Source\", \"median_PSF\", \"lower_quartile\", \"upper_quartile\"))\n\n\n\np_plotly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📈 Insight: \n\nEach region in Singapore offers a unique property market landscape catering to different buyer preferences and budgets.\nThe Central Region stands out as a high-end market, while the East offers premium properties at better values.\nThe North East and North Regions provide a mix of affordability and mid-range options, whereas the West Region offers diversity without extreme price outliers.\n\n\n\n\nEDA 3\nRidgeline plots, also known as joy plots, are used for displaying the distribution of a numerical variable across several categories.\n\nlibrary(viridis)\n\nggplot(combined_ds, aes(x = `Unit Price ($ PSF)`, y = `Planning Region`, fill = `Planning Region`)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(scale = 3) +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +\n  labs(title = \"Unit Price ($ PSF) Distribution by Planning Region\",\n       x = \"Unit Price ($ PSF)\",\n       y = \"Planning Region\") +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n📈 Insight: \n\nThe Central Region has a wide distribution, indicating a large variation in unit prices within that region. The Central Region shows unit prices extending to the highest value on the graph, above $6000 PSF, suggesting it includes the most expensive properties compared to the other regions.\nThe East, North East, North, and West Regions have their distributions concentrated below $2000 PSF, indicating that properties in these regions are generally less expensive than in the Central Region.\nEach region has a peak where the majority of the unit prices are concentrated. For instance, the North Region has a sharp peak around $1000 PSF, indicating a majority of properties are close to this price point.\nThe Central Region has a long tail on the right side, indicating a few properties with very high unit prices. Meanwhile, the West and North East Regions have distributions that marginally extend into the higher price bracket, hinting at the existence of select premium properties amidst generally more modestly priced homes."
