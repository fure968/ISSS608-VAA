#Overview

In the take home exercise 1, REALIS transaction data covering 1st Jan 2023 to 31st March 2024 had been use to make 3 different visualizations. In part 2 of this exercise, one data visualisation will be selected from our fellow classmates' work and we are task to provide a feedback in terms of clarity and aesthetics.

The original data set was from REALIS.
