# Overview

For this take-home exercise, I will select one data visualization from the [submissions](https://isss608-ay2023-24apr.netlify.app/take-home_ex/th_ex01#peer-learning) of our classmates for Take-Home Exercise 1. My task is to critique the selected visualization with respect to clarity and aesthetics. Following the critique, I will prepare a sketch for an alternative design, utilizing the principles and best practices of data visualization as covered in Lessons 1 and 2. Finally, I will recreate the original design using tools from ggplot2, its extensions, and other packages in the tidyverse suite.

The graph that has chosen is from [here](https://isss608-zjho008.netlify.app/take-home_ex/take-home_ex01/take-home_ex01). It is a geom_history made by our fellow classmate.

# First Glance

## Positive Points

-   The graph effectively clarifies the comparison across various property types, making it easy for the audience to grasp differences at a glance.

-   The colour scheme is okay and overall it is a graph with straightforward interpretation without overwhelming the viewer.

## Improvements

-   To further explore the relationship between total price and unit price per square foot across different property types, consider employing a more detailed graph, such as a violin plot. This could provide a deeper understanding of data distribution and variance within each category.

-   Enhancing the bar chart with data labels could significantly improve its readability. By directly displaying key information on the graph, viewers can quickly comprehend the data without needing to cross-reference with the axis. This step will streamline the presentation and make the information more accessible at a glance.

# Data Preparation

1.  **tidyverse**: A collection of R packages that work in harmony to handle data manipulation, exploration, and visualization. Key components include **`ggplot2`** for data visualization, **`dplyr`** for data manipulation, **`tidyr`** for tidying data, and **`readr`** for reading data, among others. It's essential for modern data science in R.

2.  **scales**: This package provides functions for mapping data to visual properties (like color, size, or shape) and formatting axes. It helps customize the scales of visual mappings in **`ggplot2`** charts, making your visualizations more readable and precise.

3.  **patchwork**: An add-on to **`ggplot2`**, designed to make it simple to combine separate ggplots into a single plot layout. It provides a user-friendly syntax for arranging and annotating multiple graphs as one cohesive visualization.

4.  **ggtext**: Enhances **`ggplot2`** by allowing richer text formatting in visualizations. With **`ggtext`**, you can use HTML and CSS to style the text elements in your plots, such as titles, labels, and annotations, giving you greater control over the text aesthetics.

5.  **DT**: Provides an interface to the JavaScript library DataTables. It allows R users to create interactive tables in R Markdown documents or Shiny web applications. These tables can be sorted, filtered, paginated, and even styled without needing to write extensive JavaScript code.

# Assuming `private_property_data` is your combined dataset

  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "grey30")

```

# Violin Chart

In this scenario, a violin plot can be a good choice for visualizing the distribution and density of 'Unit Price (\$ per square foot)' across different 'Property Types'.

The violin plot combines the both box plots and density plots, offering a deeper understanding of the data's distribution. By visually representing the data's density estimates, it reveals peaks, valleys, and the spread of the data, which are crucial for identifying patterns and outliers.

This could provide insightful details such as whether certain property types are more variable in price or if they tend to have a particular pricing structure.

## My Sketch

What I have in mind:

![](images/Sketch.png){width="541"}

## Changes Implemented

-   Transitioned to a Violin Chart: Instead of using a stacked bar chart, I have switched to a violin chart to better visualize the unit price per square meter across different property types. This change offers a clearer representation of the data distribution and variance.

-   Inclusion of IQR (Interquartile Range): The violin chart now includes the Interquartile Range (IQR) to provide a more detailed statistical summary. Additionally, users can hover over specific areas of the chart to view the exact values, enhancing interactive data exploration.

-   Modified Representation of Property Types: Rather than distinguishing property types by colour within a single chart, each property type is now represented by its own individual violin chart. This alteration avoids colour overlap and simplifies the differentiation between types, making it easier for the audience to interpret the data visually.

# Thoughts and Improvements

1.  Remove Redundant Legends: The property types are effectively differentiated by colour within the plot itself, making the legends redundant. Removing the legends will de-clutter the visual space, allowing the plot to be extended horizontally. This extension will better utilize the available space, improving the overall layout and readability.

2.  Enhance X-axis Label Readability: Given the importance of property type identification in our analysis, the text labels on the X-axis will be enlarged and bold. This adjustment ensures that these key identifiers are immediately legible, facilitating quicker and clearer comprehension by viewers.

3.  Adjust Y-axis Scale and Tick Marks: To accurately represent all data points, including outliers, the Y-axis will be extended to a maximum of at least 6,500. Additionally, tick marks will be placed every 500 units. These changes will ensure that even outlier values are visible and that the scale of the plot is practical for detailed analysis.

# Takeaways

-   Balancing clarity and aesthetics in a graph is not easy, as a visually appealing design can sometimes compromise clarity.

-   Practical experience is essential for truly understanding the nuances of coding and chart interactions. There's often a difference between our initial concepts and the final outputs, highlighting the importance of hands-on experimentation.

-   Offering critiques on others' work is not only constructive for them but also serves as a reflection for ourselves. It prompts us to reflect whether we are making similar mistakes in our own visual analytics projects.
